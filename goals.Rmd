* Learn to play harmonic

* Spread knowledge about geography and GIS

* Climb mountains that are not too tall

* Learn to make real delicious omelette rice

* See the galaxy with my bare eyes (glasses are fine)

* Visit Japan and CA with friends again and bring my families to places they want to go

* Give a/or more, if possible, dog a happy life
