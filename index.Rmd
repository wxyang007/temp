_Hello and welcome!_


__Education Background__

I'm currently pursuing my master degree of Urban Spatial Analytics in the School of Design at University of Pennsylvania. Born and raised in Beijing, China, I majored in Resources and Environmental Science at the Faculty of Geographical Science at Beijing Normal University for undergraduate study. Before leaving undergraduate school, I exchanged to Osaka University and audited at the transportation lab in the School of Engineering for one semester.
