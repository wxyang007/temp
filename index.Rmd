_Hello and welcome!_


I'm currently a master student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Urban Spatial Analytics. My research interests include applying geographic information technologies to solve ecological and environmental problems. This website records some of my previous projects and arbitrary scratches I've encountered in life.
