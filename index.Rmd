_Hello and welcome!_


I am a B.S. of Resources and Environmental Science from Beijing Normal University and a Master of Urban Spatial Analytics from University of Pennsylvania. My research interests include applying geographic information technologies to solve ecological and environmental problems. This website records some of my previous projects and arbitrary scratches I've encountered in life.
