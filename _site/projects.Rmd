## Previous Projects {.tabset}

<br>
_Below is a selection of projects that I have done previously, most of which were done during my master program. They cover a wide range of topics from farmland preservation to predicting food inspection failure. All of them involve producing and analyzing maps, some of which include interactive online map production._
